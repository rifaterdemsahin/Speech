To use OpenAI's Whisper model to transcribe audio from your microphone on Windows 11, you can follow these steps:

### 1. **Set Up Python Environment**
   - Ensure you have Python installed. If not, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
   - Open a terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell) and create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
     ```bash
     python -m venv whisper_env
     whisper_env\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - Upgrade `pip`:
     ```bash
     python -m pip install --upgrade pip
     ```

### 2. **Install Whisper and Dependencies**
   - Install Whisper and its dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install openai-whisper
     ```
   - Install PyAudio for microphone access:
     ```bash
     pip install pyaudio
     ```

### 3. **Install FFmpeg**
   - Whisper requires FFmpeg for audio processing. Download FFmpeg from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).
   - Extract the downloaded file and add the `bin` folder to your system's PATH environment variable.

### 4. **Write a Python Script to Transcribe from Microphone**
   - Create a Python script (e.g., `transcribe_mic.py`) with the following code:
     ```python
     import whisper
     import pyaudio
     import wave
     import numpy as np

     # Load the Whisper model
     model = whisper.load_model("base")  # You can use "tiny", "base", "small", "medium", or "large"

     # Parameters for recording
     FORMAT = pyaudio.paInt16
     CHANNELS = 1
     RATE = 16000
     CHUNK = 1024
     RECORD_SECONDS = 10  # Adjust as needed
     OUTPUT_FILENAME = "temp_recording.wav"

     # Initialize PyAudio
     audio = pyaudio.PyAudio()

     # Start recording
     stream = audio.open(format=FORMAT, channels=CHANNELS,
                         rate=RATE, input=True,
                         frames_per_buffer=CHUNK)
     print("Recording...")

     frames = []
     for _ in range(0, int(RATE / CHUNK * RECORD_SECONDS)):
         data = stream.read(CHUNK)
         frames.append(data)

     print("Recording finished.")

     # Stop and close the stream
     stream.stop_stream()
     stream.close()
     audio.terminate()

     # Save the recorded audio to a file
     with wave.open(OUTPUT_FILENAME, 'wb') as wf:
         wf.setnchannels(CHANNELS)
         wf.setsampwidth(audio.get_sample_size(FORMAT))
         wf.setframerate(RATE)
         wf.writeframes(b''.join(frames))

     # Transcribe the audio file
     result = model.transcribe(OUTPUT_FILENAME)
     print("Transcription: ", result["text"])
     ```

### 5. **Run the Script**
   - Run the script in your terminal:
     ```bash
     python transcribe_mic.py
     ```
   - Speak into your microphone during the recording period. The script will save the audio to a temporary file and transcribe it using Whisper.

### 6. **Adjust as Needed**
   - You can modify the `RECORD_SECONDS` variable to change the recording duration.
   - Use a larger Whisper model (e.g., `medium` or `large`) for better accuracy, but note that it will require more computational resources.

### Notes:
- Whisper is a powerful model but may require a decent CPU/GPU for larger models.
- If you encounter issues with PyAudio, ensure you have the correct version for your Python installation.
